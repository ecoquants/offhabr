\title{AquaMaps cell raster contained by BOEM blocks}
\usage{
get_am_cell_blocks_grd()
}
\value{
A `terra` raster layer with 1 layer:
\describe{
  \item{hcaf_id}{half degree cell identifier (integer) from `am_cell_blocks`}
}
}
\description{
Get raster with AquaMaps `hcaf_id` for cells contained by the BOEM blocks `boem_blocks`.
}
\details{
Cannot simply load this as an available dataset into the R package since
`terra::rast()` only loads a pointer to raster file, not its contents.
